r2165 snapshot
- new feature: Blinking room name for PK rooms has been added to the GMCP mapper.

r2164 snapshot
- new feature: The GMCP mapper's portallevel command now has a toggle for setting the level silently without printing a message by adding 'quiet' to the end: 'mapper portallevel <portal_index> <level> quiet'.
- bug fix: The communication log miniwindow (and any other miniwindow using my text_rect module with line wrapping) did not wrap the line as expected if the first character of the next color style was wider than the remaining space on the line.

r2162 snapshot
- misc change: It seems reasonable to turn off help tags when disabling/removing the helpfile miniwindow plugin.

r2161 snapshot
- bug fix: The new helpfile capture miniwindow plugin should no longer error when a theme update is invoked and the window doesn't exist.

r2160 snapshot
- misc change: The caravan area name is updated in the GMCP mapper.
- new feature: By request, I added a function to the GMCP mapper to delete all exits from a set of rooms. Since I don't know why a person would want to do it, it's only available via CallPlugin("b6eae87ccedd84f510b74714", "map_delete_exits_for_many_rooms", 32426, 32425, 32424, etc.)
- new feature: The new temper/envenom/weakened object flags have been added to the inventory serials plugin display.
- new feature: Added an experimental output capturing module wrapped_captures.lua. I'll add documentation for the wiki when I'm more comfortable with it, but for now...
- misc change: Updated the inventory serials plugin (aard_inventory_serials.xml) to use the new capture module, which simplifies the plugin code.
- new feature: There's a new miniwindow plugin for capturing in-game help files using the new capture module. See aard_ingame_help_window.xml.

r2154 snapshot
- bug fix: Changing color themes sometimes caused wrong communication log tab contents to show when clicking in their text areas. One cause of this has been fixed.
- bug fix: The GMCP mapper plugin wasn't saving its state after automatic backups, so it would keep retriggering the 24 hour backup during reconnects.
- new feature: I'm resurrecting some locked database retry logic in the GMCP mapper plugin. Maybe this will be good, maybe bad, maybe just noisy with no benefit. Let me know.
- new feature: Added pause/resume commands to the SAPI interface lua module.
- misc change: I don't remember why there was a 3 second asynchronous delay before updating the GMCP mapper database schema, but we're going to try not doing that. Hopefully nothing terrible happens.

r2149 snapshot
- bug fix: I guess I shouldn't have changed the way the inventory command works in r2141. Sorry about that.
- bug fix: The VI buffers plugin will now remember the order of your buffers if you rearrange them.
- new feature: Time.xml is a new demo plugin for how simple easy DIY miniwindow plugins can be. It's teeny tiny and just shows the current time in a miniwindow.
- new feature: There's now a toggle for the communication log tab highlighting change introduced in r2141.
- misc change: The GMCP mapper plugin will show the database corruption alert after the first integrity check fails instead of waiting until after the second check because the second check might error.
- misc change: Easy DIY miniwindow efficiency improvements.
- misc change: MUSHclient.exe has been updated so that the plugin wizard no longer selects all of your triggers, aliases, and timers by default.

r2142 snapshot
- bug fix: The easy miniwindows documentation says a nil title turns into no titlebar, so let's do that instead of erroring. 

r2141 snapshot
- bug fix: The tab mouseover highlight in the communication log should no longer go away when a new message arrives.
- bug fix: The inventory serials plugin should now correctly display item names that match color-changing triggers or #subs.
- new feature: The inventory serials plugin now accomodates using inv on a container serial number, because why not.
- new feature: Non-current tabs in the communication log will no longer get highlighted when a new message arrives if that message is shown in the current tab.
- new feature: Scrolling text miniwindows like the communication log now have easily visible indicators showing when they're not scrolled all the way to the end.
- new feature: The easy miniwindow demonstration plugin that captures helpfiles will now activate help tags.

r2135 snapshot
- bug fix: Don't freeze MUSHclient in pathological case of wrapping text in textrect with literally no space for anything. I'm not sure why I didn't catch this in r2133.
- misc change: The soundpack plugin should now play sounds by default when the client is backgrounded.

r2133 snapshot
- bug fix: Easy scrollbar movement was using the wrong reference coordinates if dragged after moving the window with WindowPosition.
- bug fix: Don't activate inventory serials in note mode.
- new feature: Easy DIY miniwindows have too many improvements to list here. Review https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Easy-DIY-Miniwindows
- new feature: There's now a demonstration plugin for easy miniwindows that captures helpfiles. Check out aard_ingame_help_window.xml in your plugins folder.

r2129 snapshot
- bug fix: Easy ThemedTextWindow resizing calculated the new scrollbar length incorrectly if the window was not resizeable.
- bug fix: Only reposition during the movewindow install 5 second check if the window is actually out of bounds.
- bug fix: Easy textrect text selection was using the wrong reference coordinates if dragged after moving the window with WindowPosition.
- bug fix: Using the new mapper where from 2125 on the current room would error.

r2125 snapshot
- bug fix: GMCP mapper will no longer error if you delete a custom exit in the room right after reloading the mapper.
- bug fix: GMCP mapper pathfinding should pollute the bottom status area a bit less.
- bug fix: My easy DIY text window should handle text updates while the user is dragging the window better now.
- misc change: GMCP mapper where output will now be printed with spaces between letter groups (27e 19u etc). I'm told that this helps screen readers.

r2121 snapshot
- misc change: Add missing license files. Credit is important.

r2120 snapshot
- bug fix: The default true value for the second argument added to ThemedTextWindow:clear in r2118 wasn't being applied properly everywhere.
- bug fix: Don't try to save nil width/height when deleting the easy themed miniwindows.

r2118 snapshot
- bug fix: Don't error if something tries to write to a non-existent tab in the communication log using storeFromOutside.
- bug fix: Keep main output scrollbar in view if exterior window is smaller than nominal.
- bug fix: The easy miniwindows should save their last size and position if deleted while resizing.
- new feature: Add warning message if something uses the obsolete ugly way of accessing GMCP data but forgot to populate the gmcpdata variable. This is only for old things that don't use the gmcp() function.
- new feature: The add_text and clear functions of the ThemedTextWindow easy miniwindow has an optional second argument for whether to immediately redraw the window after adding/clearing the text. The default value is true.
- new feature: The add_3d_text_button function of the ThemedBasicWindow easy miniwindow has optional width and height arguments to control the button size. Using these will negate the x_padding and y_padding arguments.

r2112 snapshot
- new feature: The easy miniwindows now get colorized multi-line titles. Examples have been added to the wiki page at https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Easy-DIY-Miniwindows
- new feature: Improved multiline conversion in ColoursToStyles function in aardwolf_colors.lua.
- new feature: Added $C color resets in ColoursToStyles function in aardwolf_colors.lua.
- misc change: GMCP parsing errors will generate more verbose output and instructions.
- misc change: Added some visual tweaks to the easy miniwindows prototype.

r2110 snapshot
- bug fix: One of the menu code changes needed to make easy miniwindows work got screwed up in the communication log plugin, which broke the plugin if you tried to rename the main tab. Thanks Khadaji!
- bug fix: An empty string for miniwindow title should also draw a titlebar and just be blank instead of no titlebar at all.

r2108 snapshot
- bug fix: Fix the inventory serials plugin to also show any flags it doesn't yet know about. Aardwolf is getting a new item flag for cursed items.
- bug fix: Undo the main output scrollbar change from r2090. It was causing display issues when resizing the main area.
- bug fix: Fix text_rect.lua newline handling when the new text autowrap toggle is disabled.
- bug fix: Fix a new gap between the scrollbar and the resizer in the channel capture miniwindow. Probably caused by changes made for the new easy miniwindows.
- new feature: The ColoursToStyles function in aardwolf_colors.lua now has a multiline option that will split at newlines into a nested table with multiple lines of style runs.
- new feature: The new ThemedTextWindow easy miniwindow now has a "do the right thing" :add_text function that combines both :add_styles and :add_color_line into one and also allows you to pass in multiple lines of styles at once (table of tables of styles). The page at https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Easy-DIY-Miniwindows has been updated accordingly.

r2102 snapshot
- new feature: New add_3d_text_button method for the easy miniwindows.

r2101 snapshot
- bug fix: Fixed a few more scrollback split highlighting issues introduced by the recent MUSHclient executable update. Might have added some new ones too. I hope not!

r2100 snapshot
- MAJOR NEW FEATURE: There's a new experimental Lua module to make creating miniwindow plugins one-click easy. A lot of things had to change internally for this to work, so it may cause problems in existing plugins. Let me know. Read about it at https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Easy-DIY-Miniwindows
- bug fix: The MUSHclient.exe update in r2092 made highlighting text in the scrollback split lower section bounce around a bit.

r2093 snapshot
- bug fix: The recon capture added in r2090 was overly greedy, and blocked access to recoveries.

r2092 snapshot
- bug fix: MUSHclient.exe is updated to fix sometimes not being able to select the last character on a line.
- bug fix: Disabling and reenabling the layout plugin should properly re-draw the synthetic scrollbar.

r2090 snapshot
- new feature: The GMCP mapper will now automatically mark rooms noportal/norecall during recon.
- new feature: The group monitor has a few new display options, including one without any gauges. I'm still working on the draw layout for that mode.
- misc change: Some minor code reshuffling should hopefully make the fake themed scrollbar that I put on the main output rectangle redraw itself less when not needed.
- bug fix: The ascii map miniwindow would error if you tried to resize it while the plugin was initializing.
- bug fix: You probably wouldn't hit this, but a bug would have broken the communication log right-click menu if the chat echo plugin weren't loaded.

r2085 snapshot
- bug fix: Update MUSHclient.exe to fix some reported I-beam cursor display problems (cursor turns black, doesn't obey OS size settings, etc).
- bug fix: Cancelling a selection by clicking in the main area will now unpause (selecting pauses) if the output is scrolled to the end so that the backscroll split isn't invoked when the next output arrives if nothing is selected.

r2083 snapshot
- bug fix: While fixing text_rect selection in 2078, I broke copying (oops). Copying from text_rect plugins like the communication log should work again now.

r2082 snapshot
- new feature: There's a new plugin aard_vital_shortcuts.xml that adds some aliases for briefly displaying player vital percentages. I'm told that this will be useful to players using screen readers. It will be loaded by default for brand new installs, but current users will need to add the plugin manually after upgrading. The help command for this plugin is "vitals help".

r2081 snapshot
- new feature: The text_rect module used by the communication log and splitscreen scrollback plugins now supports bold text. If you have the "show bold" output setting enabled, bold colors use the bold font variant in MUSHclient. This will now be reflected in those plugins as well. Plugins aren't notified when output settings changes occur, so if you change this you may have to click in those miniwindows to force them to update.

r2080 snapshot
- bug fix: The text_rect module used by the communication log and splitscreen scrollback plugins checked for left-button mouse clicks incorrectly, leading to errors when highlighting text after a double-click.

r2079 snapshot
- new feature: Adds a require stub for aardwolf_colors.lua in the lua folder. Only use it if you understand how require and dofile differ.

r2078 snapshot
- bug fix: Fix the error doing arithmetic on end_copying_pos when copying past the end of available comm log text. I rewrote all of the selection and copying code. Bug fix or bug add? We'll find out!
- misc change: The minimum output scrollback split size when is reduced from 10 lines to 5.
- new feature: Mapper cexits can be edited through the GUI.
- new feature: A 'mapper fullcexit' command has been added to the GMCP mapper.
- new feature: An entry for the sub/gag plugin has been added to 'aard help'.

r2074 snapshot
- misc change: The sub/gag plugin now uses regular expressions but defaults to plain text with a new #regex flag. It should automatically convert your existing patterns. If anything stops working, contact Fiendish.

r2073 snapshot
- bug fix: Copying text from the communication log was skipping some characters at line breaks. Should be fixed now.

r2072 snapshot
- bug fix: Pressing PageUp/PageDown when the splitscreen scrollback plugin is active should scroll the right amount according to where the screen split is. Now watchmen have to go back to their old logo plz thx. Icecool says so.

r2071 snapshot
- bug fix: The filtered mapper portals index numbers should now be safe for deletion.

r2070 snapshot
- bug fix: Communication log plugin state-trashing error during color theme management was happening because state files have a previously-unknown-to-me size limit.
- new feature: The mapper portals command has a new here/<area> filter argument.

r2068 snapshot
- bug fix: MUSHclient's main output area should be easier to scroll with high resolution touchpads.
- bug fix: Fix leftover group monitor tooltip hotspots by just not making them in the first place. Crowley said this would be ok.
- misc change: Adjust the layout reset positions so that the new main output scrollbar isn't behind stuff.
- new feature: The Draw3DTextBox theme function now takes arguments for being pressed in and also X and Y padding.

r2064 snapshot
- bug fix: Clear hotspots from defunct scrollback splits.

r2063 snapshot
- bug fix: scrollbar.lua scroll callbacks may not always have parent objects.

- bug fix: Update MUSHclient.exe to fix several performance issues when scrolling with the scrollbar hidden.
- new feature: Add a setting to scrollbar.lua for minimum "thumb" size.
- new feature: Attach a themed scrollbar to the main output. Right-click on the main output resizer in the corner for a quick option to show/hide the external scrollbar.
- info: Want to know how I add a scrollbar to something now? See the highlighted section of https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/commit/3d83ea99b65c9245b63535e0f38e8761b618c7fa#diff-12c0930bea5951bfca63a681220fb542R529-R535

r2052 snapshot
- bug fix: Try to patch around reported ascii map problem disabling prompts sometimes. Everyone loves ice cream.

r2051 snapshot

r2050 snapshot
- bug fix: Adding the communication log log (lol) split option to the right-click menu caused the wrong entry to be disabled when there was only one tab, which prevented making new communication log tabs.

r2049 snapshot
- revert: I'm undoing the input bar change for now until I can fix what's causing black on black input bars for people.

r2048 snapshot
- bug fix: Wrong telopts being sent when entering note mode was throwing off the prompt fixer. Heavy sigh.
- bug fix: Group channel (not grouptalk) added to the default list of channels that the communication log knows about.
- bug fix: The communication log has a tighter check for remote socials, so the Tilule directory won't be caught anymore.
- new feature: The input bar will now be set to use the theme background and body text colors.

r2045 snapshot
- new feature: The communication log's...uhh...log now has an option to start a fresh file after reaching a certain size.
- new feature: Added an optional flag to omit messages stored from the communication log's log (I need a better name for this) when using StoreFromOutside.
- bug fix: A text_rect module change for splitscreen overlay maptype echo capture in 2036 accidentally broke extended ascii captures. Now they both work at the same time.
- misc change: Unmapped rooms are a bit more visible in the mapper GUI.
- misc change: The default value for add_timestamp in storeFromOutside is now true. Blame and/or thank Endymion and Durel.

r2027 snapshot
- bug fix: More fluid scrolling with less main body flicker in the splitscreen scrollback plugin.

r2025 snapshot
- bug fix: Fix an error in splitscreen when scrolling back across long lines that get wrapped (actually a bug in text_rect when adding new lines).

r1987 snapshot
- misc change: Pwar's soundpack plugin will be automatically installed now. It starts with everything off unless you're using the non-visual package, so I don't see a good reason to not load it.

r1986 snapshot

r1964 snapshot
- bug fix: Some triggers were accidentally enabled by default in the soundpack plugin.

r1963 snapshot
- bug fix: Another day, another stupid bug in the prompt fixer plugin.

r1962 snapshot

r1956 snapshot
- bug fix: A latent memory access bug in all prior versions of MUSHclient could randomly lead to crashes or other client errors.

r1955 snapshot
- misc change: A lot of plugin variables will save more immediately now, which should prevent some configuration loss in the event of a crash.
- bug fix: People have reported that the chat echo plugin was gagging certain non-channel messages when it should have been showing them. My best guess at solving this involves making sure that they are turned on for everyone. If you want them omitted from output, hide them again.
- new feature: async.lua now has HEAD and GETFILE functions for getting just header information without file contents and for downloading directly to a file, respectively.
- new feature: async.lua's doAsyncRemoteRequest function can take an additional argument (string or table) to control how the request is sent. See inline comments and implementation of HEAD and GETFILE functions.
- misc change: Lua socket code has been updated to enable SNI in TLS requests and to harden the communicated cipher suite.

r1950 snapshot
- misc change: Included DLLs are now compiled statically, removing the need for MSVCR100.DLL (which was interfering with TTS performance for some users for some reason).
- misc change: The text substitution plugin should now have less impact on client performance.
- misc change: The universal TTS plugin will no longer do text substitutions if you are using a real screen reader and not just plain Microsoft Speech.
- new feature: An "ftts" alias will toggle a setting to silence speech in the universal TTS plugin when MUSHclient is in the background.
- bug fix: The communication log will no longer capture the DSR repop message.
- bug fix: universal TTS plugin now also reads plugin messages in addition to server output.

r1947 snapshot
- bug fix: Move TTS DLLs to top level, to make them easier to find.

r1946 snapshot
- bug fix: Channel transitions and hidden map requests were causing extra blank lines to appear sometimes. Those should be gone now.
- misc change: The color of the border ring around the dot in the alignment indicator in the health bars plugin sometimes didn't coordinate with the chosen alignment color. It is calculated differently now and should match more reliably.

r1944 snapshot
- misc change: Display an indicator of having the non-visual version in 'checkversion' output.

r1943 snapshot
- misc change: The inventory serials hint message will only display 3 times and then go away on its own.

r1942 snapshot
- bug fix: I think the inventory serials activation change from r1940 should actually happen now.
- bug fix: Multiline socials in the communication log were accidentally uglified around r1886. This should unbreak them.

r1940 snapshot
- new feature: We're testing out a new second installer for VI players that bypasses purely visual plugins that might interfere with screen readers and also loads (hopefully) text to speech by default.
- misc change: The inventory serials plugin will no longer be active by default. It will still be loaded and will inform the player of its existence until the player looks at it.

r1938 snapshot
- bug fix: Don't only lock miniwindow positions (when using aard layout lock) if they have a preprocessor function defined.

r1937 snapshot
- bug fix: Remove an innocuous but scary looking and unnecessary alert message in the movewindow code.

r1936 snapshot
- bug fix: Fixed an error saving the bigmap position while not merged into the GMCP mapper miniwindow.

r1935 snapshot
- bug fix: Some people had reported miniwindows not staying in the right place after r1927. It turns out that this was actually a bug in the official version of movewindow.lua. The fix for this has also been reported to Nick Gammon.
- bug fix: 'resetaard' should now correctly default miniwindow sizes again after being somewhat broken by changes made for the layout profile feature.
- new feature: The inventory serials plugin now has a mode toggle. Type 'inventory serials help' to see more.
- new feature: Thanks to Mendaloth, the channel capture plugin will now also capture remote socials. Adding a toggle for this is very low priority.

r1930 snapshot
- bug fix: Don't crash the GMCP mapper when clicking on a room's ghost after deleting it.
- bug fix: A poorly chosen variable name in aard_requirements.lua was very likely to conflict with anything else using a database. This caused transaction errors in the GMCP mapper and possibly other plugins.
- new feature: Universal text to speech plugin now has Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+0 macros for replaying the ten most recently shown lines.

r1927 snapshot
- new feature: Aardwolf_Main_Layout (aard_layout.xml) now has the ability to save and restore named layouts. Read 'aard layout help' for commands. Plugins that save intermediate/proxy/local variables instead of the actual miniwindow coordinates may be incompatible until changed. The included plugins have been updated appropriately.
- new feature: The GMCP mapper has a 'mapper backups quiet' toggle for fastidious players who don't want to see messages when the automatic backup is running. Manual backups still show messages.
- misc change: The GMCP mapper compressed backups will hopefully now stay in the background when a different app is full-screened.
- bug fix: GMCP mapper backups will not continue to be blocked by a persistent 'fighting' status if the player gets disconnected.
- bug fix: VI command output capturing plugin will run before the URL hyperlinking plugin, so that the untriggerable hyperlinks don't interfere with capturing.
- bug fix: Umpteenth prompt fixer plugin bug fix. Dangling spaces after %c weren't being removed. It'd be real nice if Aardwolf just forced all prompts to always end in %c so this plugin could finally die.
- bug fix: MUSHclient's activity window has always worthless. Force that to not open at launch anymore.

r1920 snapshot
- bug fix: Unescaped %c in the plugin trigger send box caused the prompt fixer plugin to error if you tried to change your prompt while some lines of text were copied to the OS clipboard.

r1919 snapshot
- bug fix: Bast had changed something in his eq miniwindow to match a change I had made at the same time as I was making a change to match what he had had before, which ended up breaking it again. Let's fix it here to save him more hassle.

r1918 snapshot
- bug fix: The fix in r1917 had an unintentional side effect of preventing the display of command inputs longer than the width of the window. They should show wrapped onto the next line, but were accidentally being hidden instead. This should be fixed.

r1917 snapshot
- bug fix: Main output sizing at startup should be more reliable now.

r1916 snapshot
- bug fix: New MUSHclient 5.06 prerelease build that hopefully finally fixes the bug where miniwindows would sometimes turn black. ( https://mushclient.com/forum/bbshowpost.php?id=11315 )

r1914 snapshot
- bug fix: A few of the new client settings that are force-enabled will only be activated once instead of every launch, but for real this time.

r1913 snapshot
- new feature: The inventory serials plugin now does vault items too.

r1912 snapshot
- misc change: New MUSHclient 5.06 prerelease build. ( https://github.com/nickgammon/mushclient/commit/2d7a2bb47f157eea39b42d2a2023b38a70225fd5 )
- bug fix: I was noticing a few funny echos, so I shrunk the compact check code a bit to do the same with less.
- new feature: The prompt fixer plugin will now also catch when the player changes their prompt to remove the trailing %c.

r1910 snapshot
- bug fix: The chat echo plugin will now show all channels in main output if it doesn't detect any chat capture miniwindows.
- bug fix: The chat echo plugin will wait for a safe char.status.state before checking your compact settings.
- bug fix: A few of the new client settings that are force-enabled will only be activated once instead of every launch.
- misc change: The GMCP mapper will default to not drawing underlines on its hyperlinks because it is unsightly to have so many in a dense list.
- bug fix: Color handling functions should now be responsive to ANSI color settings changes in your client.
- bug fix: Fixes an infinite loop when resizing the mapper miniwindow to its minimum size.
- bug fix: Fixes compatibility with old versions of some 3rd party plugins that were looking for a colors-related variable I had removed.
- new feature: Adds a new demonstration plugin for translating non-English languages on your ftalk channel. (aard_translate_foreign_friends.xml)
- new feature: Adds a new universal (hopefully) text to speech/braille plugin (and DLLs) using the Tolk speech and braille abstraction API. Also adds a SAPI-only plugin for when you definitely know you don't have a screen reader intalled. (universal_text_to_speech.xml and SAPI.xml)
- misc change: Removed a bunch of crufty plugins that are just sitting around in the installer, unrelated to the project. This will not remove them from pre-existing installations.

r1900 snapshot
- bug fix: Copying selected text in the communication log was not truncating the text properly.
- bug fix: The group window was erroring on send to back, and other related functions.
- bug fix: The communication log window was not capturing unechoed infos.
- bug fix: Multiline triggers will now work in conjunction with the text substitution plugin. ( https://github.com/nickgammon/mushclient/commit/d9706abe79c384e641da197f19f016c9c4f262fc )
- bug fix: The GMCP mapper backups were not staying disabled if you disabled them.
- misc change: Updating to the MUSHclient 5.06 prerelease build for the multiline trigger fix.

r1899 snapshot
- new feature: The GMCP mapper has an option now to toggle off/on underlining of the hyperlinks.
- bug fix: Beep on pages when chat echo is off.

r1898 snapshot
- misc change: Updated to MUSHclient 5.05 (see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- new feature: There is now a plugin for #sub and #gag (aard_text_substitution.xml). Some people have been asking for this for a very long time. Sorry it took so long. Load it and type "#sub help"
- MAJOR CHANGE: Channel messages now only arrive over GMCP. Say goodbye to channel tags.
- new feature: The GMCP handler has been rewritten to make getting gmcp data easier. See https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Using-GMCP
- new feature: Tags now only get activated for the current session instead of persisting into other logins that possibly aren't made with a client that understands them. I hope this leads to fewer "why are all these tags showing?" queries.
- new feature: There's now a fun little experiment in lua\online_translation.lua for doing translations between different languages using google translation servers. We'll just have to see how long it takes until they actually shut down free access to the translation API like they said they're going to.
- misc change: The in-place updater experiment is over. I decided to get rid of it in favor of an installer ( https://fiendish.github.io/aardwolfclientpackage/ ). If you point it at your previous MUSHclient folder, the installer will safely preserve your world, state, and mapper database files.
- new feature for developers: There are some more functions for dealing with colors in aardwolf_colors.lua
- bug fix: A few obscure bugs were found in color processing code.
- bug fix: One more attempt at a prompt-fixing plugin. So help me god, if one more person has a problem with it freezing their output I'm going to picket outside of Lasher's house until he forces all prompts to end in %c without my intervention.
- bug fix: Fixed some errors in GMCP mapper bounceportal/bouncerecall caused by inconsistency if the portal entry is removed.

r1887 snapshot
- bug fix: GMCP mapper notes display was disfigured by MUSHclient's new deferred noting in callbacks

r1886 snapshot
- bug fix: recent color improvements introduced a color bleed that is now fixed.
- bug fix: changing ANSI color display settings could in some instances cause an error message during some color conversion routines.

r1885 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 5.03 (see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- bug fix: disable room desc tags when disabling ascii map plugin.
- misc change: use Execute instead of Send for the player commands in the aard_VI_command_output plugin.
- new feature: detect font monospacedness in the ascii map plugin.
- misc change: autoactivate utf8 mode when loading the ascii map plugin.
- bug fix: no longer error on empty capture in the aard_VI_command_output plugin.
- misc change: request ascii map on death, because the MUD doesn't do that automatically.
- new feature: add compact toggles to the GMCP mapper. Thanks VBMeireles!
- bug fix: last selected character capture in the copy color codes plugin.
- misc change: use a copyable color for gmcp debug output.
- new feature: several new functions added to aardwolf_colors.
- new feature: inventory serials plugin now supports the keyring.

r1871 snapshot
- bug fix: update the mapper help for fullportal to match the recent command format change.

r1870 snapshot
- misc change: the statmon miniwindow plugin has more compact labels that waste less space.
- new feature: the statmon miniwindow has an option for showing gold with commas.
- misc change: one of the experimental text substitution plugins has been removed. Substitutions without GMCP are just not good.
- new feature: if the GMCP mapper is hidden using "mapper hide", it will stay hidden across sessions.
- new feature: the GMCP mapper has a new "mapper updown" command to toggle showing up and down exits.
- bug fix/misc change: the GMCP mapper's fullportal command has a new syntax that better separates the input arguments.
- new feature: the GMCP mapper now in theory allows portal creation to nomap rooms (though the room still needs to be uniquely named to work properly).
- new feature: GMCP mapper search results are now numbered, and the "mapper next" command correspondingly accepts a numeric argument.
- new feature: there is a new plugin meant to assist players who use screen readers by capturing the output from game commands and sending it to a MUSHclient notepad. The plugin is called aard_VI_command_output.xml. For now it has an accompanying readme file.
- misc change: if you accidentally replace the LuaJIT DLL with another one, the package will now alert you. Don't do it. It breaks things.

r1860 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 5.01 (see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- new feature: ascii map plugin will only automatically request updates if the player is active so they shouldn't keep you from idling out.
- new feature: mapper backups internally store the date and time of when they were created.
- bug fix/misc change: luasec replaced by lua-openssl, because luasec was not thread-safe. This should solve some hangs/crashes. Hopefully this doesn't cause other SSL connectivity regressions for anyone. (updater)
- misc change: remove some plugins that are distributed with MUSHclient by default that I consider harmful to the package.
- bug fix: replace old code.google.com links in the new connection plugin.
- comment: I have the nagging feeling that I've forgotten to include something in this release, but I don't know what.

r1851 snapshot
- bug fix: Windows XP returns error 1026 if an FO_DELETE operation is attempted for a file that doesn't exist (updater)
- bug fix: string comparisons should be plain (updater)

r1850 snapshot
- misc change: with GMCP mapper cexits it should now be possible to visually draw exits between rooms that are nomap but still actually unique. You have to manually flag the room to ignore exits mismatches and then create a single-letter direction cexit. This will probably fail in funny ways for non-unique rooms.
- bug fix: ascii map plugin will no longer request map updates if a room description kinda sorta looks like a door opening or closing.
- bug fix: use luajit's FFI interface to replace calls to os.execute in the package updater plugin with direct Windows API calls because os.execute was freezing MUSHclient for at least one player.
- bug fix: unload plugins before moving files around with the new updater, because a loaded plugin might be keeping a file locked.

r1845 snapshot
- bug fix: detect file download failures during updates and gently retry a few times.
- misc change: move version file checks to a more central location to hopefully avoid the file handle being held open accidentally by bad copy+pastes.

r1843 snapshot
- bug fix: two plugins didn't close the version file after opening it, leading to access permission errors in the updater

r1842 snapshot
- bug fix: update plugin now seen working in Windows XP. Wine's xcopy prints "<#> file(s) copied" with a lowercase f, but Windows's xcopy prints "<#> File(s) copied" with a capital F.
- misc change: confirm at package update whether to update in place or to download the .zip instead
- new feature: mapper notes room (or mapper notes thisroom) will print mapper notes for just the current room

r1840 snapshot
- bug fix: hopefully fix bad github merge

r1835 snapshot
- new feature: the package update plugin now actually tries to update the package in place for you instead of just pointing to a download link.
- new feature: using async io with the "async" require is now a lot easier.
- bug fix: fixes an error on loading the bigmap plugin if the gmcp mapper is absent
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.99 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1830 snapshot
- bug fix: should fix a bug reported with the GMCP mapper where adjacent from starting room cexits weren't being used.
- misc change: The GMCP mapper is now more thorough about database integrity checks because several reported bugs occured because of database file integrity errors.
- new feature: The bigmap display now optionally loads custom map images. See https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage/wiki/Bigmap-display#custom-bigmap-images for details.

- new feature: the ASCII map will no longer ask for map updates during a GMCP mapper initiated run.

r1820 snapshot
- new feature: You can now command 'mapper cexits thisroom' to see cexits in the current room.
- bug fix: ASCII map plugin will no longer request a map update automatically if the player is in note mode or sleeping.
- misc change: map DB should be slightly smaller
- new feature: rooms in the GMCP mapper can now be flagged to ignore when your stored exits don't match those sent by the MUD so your changed exits don't get forcibly overriden.
- bug fix: the mapper database corruption alert message points to the new wiki location for information.
- misc change: some GMCP mapper right-click options now use submenus to directly access options instead of a popup dialog.
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.98 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1816 snapshot
- bug fix: #alias and #trigger world aliases were broken. Apparently world aliases and triggers can't be made with equal signs in the name. Sigh. Oops. Nobody reported this? Maybe nobody uses them.

r1815 snapshot
- info: A change crept into the the previous release that apparently wasn't fully baked yet. The chat echo plugin now runs with a plugin sequence of -5000, which will make it run before everything else, so if you're triggering on channel tags anywhere you'll need to either switch to using GMCP or set your plugin priority lower. See http://mushclient.com/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbsubject_id=12790
- bug fix: Also make comm log plugin have sequence -5000 so that it catches unechoed lines.
- bug fix: GMCP mapper should now be better about flagging wrong rooms as noportal/norecall when moving while blind.
- new feature: GMCP mapper has new aliases for manual noportal/norecall flagging.
- misc change: GMCP mapper will run instead of portal to an immediately adjacent room.

r1810 snapshot

- new feature: there's a new "gmcp(data)" function in gmcphelper.lua for fetching GMCP data in a simple "do-what-I-mean" way. Thanks Cizra!
- new feature: requests new overhead map on area repops. Thanks Abelinc!
- bug fix: GMCP mapper no longer spams the server with area info requests when speedwalking through an unmapped area.
- new feature: ASCII rooms can be whitelisted to always echo in main. makes use of the gmcp room.info send-order change.
- bug fix: using the new whitelist feature, the garden rooms inside the gardener's brain in FT2 will now display their ASCII map.
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.97 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1805 snapshot
- bug fix: wrong level check in mapper was causing errors when bounce rooms led to paths through certain locked exits
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.96 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1803 snapshot
- misc change: let mapper work without luajit

r1802 snapshot
- bug fix: default position for stat miniwindow needs to conform to new size
- misc change: default maptype 1 instead of 2 for new players

r1801 snapshot
- misc change: change default fonts to Courier New instead of Courier for UTF8 boxchar support

r1800 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.93 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- new feature: add support for new UTF-8 maptypes in the ascii map plugin. (Make sure you pick UTF-8 capable fonts! I use Courier New.)
- misc change: remove Saves from stat display, because it is being phased out.
- misc change: streamline GMCP mapper configuration box in preparation to maybe add some other options more useful than the silly color configuration that nobody should be using.
- bug fix: make sure triggers are enabled before requesting the automap.
- bug fix: remove the arbitrary length limit on the ascii map so that test port tetris works again (heh).

r1797 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.92 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1795 snapshot

r1793 snapshot
- bug fix: new SSL dll should work better (at all?)
- new feature: ability to spawn low level threads in plugins added via lua-llthreads
- misc change: package updater should now do https request in a background thread

r1792 snapshot
- bug fix: need to add a hidden file for the new git repository to preserve the comm logs folder

r1791 snapshot
- misc change: everything is migrating over to github. Using git means that snapshot revision numbers are going to increment much more slowly now, because they aren't "real".
- misc change: GMCP mapper list functions no longer pathfind all results by default so that searches are faster. To change this back, use the 'mapper quicklist' feature.
- new feature: include luasec in the package to enable SSL socket connections
- bug fix: remove GMCP mapper bounceportal/bouncerecall designations if the portals get deleted

r1790 snapshot

- bug fix: fix default color injection in ColoursToStyles helper function
- misc change: don't rely on the server sending room gmcp info along with area info, just request it
- bug fix: use callplugin instead of execute to mediate the main output channel echo toggle from the communication log window to fix toggling while writing notes
- bug fix: don't force cexits to be lowercase
- bug fix: fix deleting of single character cexits
- new feature: queue gmcp room broadcasts during mapprt backups and handle them in the GMCP mapper after backup is complete

r1773 snapshot
- bug fix: remove all virtual areas instead of just the one recently left, because users don't always upgrade right away and there might be a buildup of old virtual areas

r1771 snapshot
- misc change: LuaJIT updated to 2.0.2 (see luajit.org for details)
- new feature: areas flagged "virtual" by the game are considered temporary and will be removed from the GMCP mapper database when you leave
- new feature: the GMCP mapper help is now searchable via 'mapper help search <text>'
- bug fix: don't try to backup the GMCP mapper database if it isn't open
- new feature: the GMCP mapper now displays your total number of mapped rooms when using the 'mapper areas' command
- bug fix: the health bars miniwindow could error on plugin start due to a weirdness in how MUSHclient sizes its window when starting up

r1748 snapshot

- bug fix: the GMCP mapper help for command 'mapper unmapped' had a typo
- misc change: don't report "-1" exits in the GMCP mapper unmapped command output
- bug fix: the status bars plugin has various technical display fixes
- bug fix: don't error on checking for package updates if the current directory pointer has been moved (e.g. the load plugin dialog is open)

r1723 snapshot
(December 2012 release)
- one last change before release, renamed aard_inventory_additions plugin to aard_inventory_serials

r1720 snapshot
- misc change: LuaJIT updated to 2.0 (see luajit.org for details)

r1716 snapshot
- bug fix: gmcp mapper room notes missing since the last snapshot should now show up again
- bug fix: group monitor was erroring upon group invitation if you'd previously left a group with hidden members
- bug fix: group monitor should pick up more invite/cancel messages (player leaves game, etc)

r1711 snapshot
- bug fix: the gmcp mapper won't try to mark the room noportal/norecall if you are blinded or have moved away from the room
- bug fix: the query collapsing function in the gmcp mapper from r1693 would throw an error if the area had nomap rooms with single quotes in their names
- misc change: the error message shown by the gmcp mapper when a pathfind triggers another pathfind should be a bit less opaque
- bug fix: the #trigger alias should now set up triggers to send to execute instead of world

r1700 snapshot
- bug fix: I accidentally broke the mapper portal command in r1693 with some errant debug lines. Oops. Thanks Saerec.
- misc change: the popup that shows when mousing over 'mapper portals' list entries now shows the complete command sequence in addition to the destination

r1697 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.84 (see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- misc change: if timers or triggers are disabled, invoking wait.lua methods should give friendlier error messages instead of assertion errors
- misc change: mapper tooltip popups should stay up longer now

r1693 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.82 (see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )
- bug fix: some cruft accidentally got into the default recent file list
- misc change: styles to ansi conversion avoids spamming the user when doing stupid things like trying to change channel colors via trigger instead of colorset (seriously? come on)
- bug fix: resizing the embedded bigmap was horribly broken
- bug fix: mapper resizing should now stop at minimum size greater than 0
- bug fix: moving the embedded bigmap display was not properly saving the coordinates for the position of the mapper window which caused the window to jump back when reloading the mapper plugin
- bug fix: gmcp mapper portal/recall overlap could cause unnecessary extra step to be taken to get to the portal/recall destination in a noportal/norecall room
- new feature: added an indicator of designated bouncerecall and bounceportal in the gmcp mapper portals list
- bug fix: in the communication log window, right-clicking a url but then "going to" it only after the log had scrolled from new chats would cause an error
- bug fix: unrelated but visually similar URLs in the communication log window would get highlighted together
- misc change: the gmcp mapper should be a bit more efficient about displaying newly entered areas by collapsing many small database queries into one large one
- new feature: new gmcp mapper command fullportal takes <keywords> <destination id> <level> parameters up front

r1667 snapshot
- bug fix: don't abort mapper run attempts when gmcp data may be slow

r1658 snapshot
- new feature: make exit locks work differently from portal locks. portals still account for tiers, exits will not.
- misc change: mapper diagonal lines for up/down exits are now on the same side as the markers in the ascii map
- misc change: mapper shownotes should default true instead of false
- misc change: if background texture fails to load use a nicer color than the funny greenish one

r1627 snapshot

- new feature: the gmcp mapper will alert you and wait until combat is over before doing a backup

r1476 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.79 (skipped 4.78 due to bugs)

- new feature: gmcp mapper will now automatically flag rooms as norecall/noportal when you bounce off the barriers. these flags will be partially taken into account when finding paths (pathfinding will not bounce through multiple portal exits, so no "home->enter" combos). to aid in this, there is a new command "mapper portalrecall <index>" which flags a mapper portal as specifically being a recall/home type. flagged portals will show red in the portals listing.
- bug fix: health bars should now also show the enemy hp numeric overlay in modes other than "Standard"

r1319 snapshot
