Aardwolf Client Package Major Changes List

r1825 snapshot:

- misc change: The ASCII map "echo" menu option has been reworded for clarity.
- new feature: new Show Room Name toggle added to the ASCII map miniwindow
- new feature: the ASCII map will no longer ask for map updates during a GMCP mapper initiated run.

r1820 snapshot:
- new feature: You can now command 'mapper cexits thisroom' to see cexits in the current room.
- bug fix: ASCII map plugin will no longer request a map update automatically if the player is in note mode or sleeping.
- misc change: map DB should be slightly smaller
- new feature: rooms in the GMCP mapper can now be flagged to ignore when your stored exits don't match those sent by the MUD so your changed exits don't get forcibly overriden.

- misc change: some GMCP mapper right-click options now use submenus to directly access options instead of a popup dialog.
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.98 ( see release notes http://www.mushclient.com/scripts/showrelnote.php )

r1816 snapshot:
- bug fix: #alias and #trigger world aliases were broken. Apparently world aliases and triggers can't be made with equal signs in the name. Sigh. Oops. Nobody reported this? Maybe nobody uses them.

r1815 snapshot:
- info: A change crept into the the previous release that apparently wasn't fully baked yet. The chat echo plugin now runs with a plugin sequence of -5000, which will make it run before everything else, so if you're triggering on channel tags anywhere you'll need to either switch to using GMCP or set your plugin priority lower. See http://mushclient.com/forum/bbshowpost.php?bbsubject_id=12790
- bug fix: Also make comm log plugin have sequence -5000 so that it catches unechoed lines.
- bug fix: GMCP mapper should now be better about flagging wrong rooms as noportal/norecall when moving while blind.
- new feature: GMCP mapper has new aliases for manual noportal/norecall flagging.
- misc change: GMCP mapper will run instead of portal to an immediately adjacent room.

- new feature: requests new overhead map on area repops. Thanks Abelinc!
- bug fix: GMCP mapper no longer spams the server with area info requests when speedwalking through an unmapped area.

r1792 snapshot

- new feature: add safety wrappers to temporarily force open/closed a database for running queries when the db is normally closed due to being disconnected from the game (dropbox updating problem)
- bug fix: yet another prompt fixer error found when battleprompt was too long to change. maybe this one will finally work for all cases? (it'd be nice if we could just get prompts unbroken on the server side)
- bug fix: fix default color injection in ColoursToStyles helper function
- misc change: don't rely on the server sending room gmcp info along with area info, just request it
- bug fix: use callplugin instead of execute to mediate the main output channel echo toggle from the communication log window to fix toggling while writing notes
- bug fix: don't force cexits to be lowercase
- bug fix: fix deleting of single character cexits
- new feature: queue gmcp room broadcasts during mapprt backups and handle them in the GMCP mapper after backup is complete

r1773 snapshot
- bug fix: remove all virtual areas instead of just the one recently left, because users don't always upgrade right away and there might be a buildup of old virtual areas

- bug fix: the query collapsing function in the gmcp mapper from r1693 would throw an error if the area had nomap rooms with single quotes in their names
- misc change: the error message shown by the gmcp mapper when a pathfind triggers another pathfind should be a bit less opaque
- bug fix: the #trigger alias should now set up triggers to send to execute instead of world

r1700 snapshot

- bug fix: some very dark xterm 256 colors get brightened by Aardwolf (text colorization in places like the communication log window now reflects this)

- new feature: the gmcp mapper will alert you and wait until combat is over before doing a backup

r1479 snapshot

r1476 snapshot
- misc change: updated to MUSHclient 4.79 (skipped 4.78 due to bugs)

- bug fix: the mapper database structure is updated to use TEXT instead of the erroneous STRING column types where useful
- new feature: bouncerecall/bounceportal storage has been moved from the plugin state file into the map database for easier portability. other configs may also move in the future.

- new feature: 'mapper notes' command now accepts <area> and here parameters
- misc change: miniwindows will clean up after themselves better when their respective plugins close
- bug fix: mousing from one part to another part of a line-wrapped hyperlink that has percent signs in it will no longer abort the channel capture plugin

- misc change: add comment about using ;; to avoid splitting lines while stacking commands in mapper help

- bug fix: gmcp mapper exit level lock inputs are now sanitized
- bug fix: clear the status bar after finished gmcp mapper pathfinding

r1326 snapshot
- new feature: the gmcp mapper now accepts level locks on standard exits. this is useful for blocking undesirable short paths through aggressive mobs and difficult doors. you can edit exit level locks by right-clicking on a room and choosing the menu option.
- new feature: gmcp mapper will now automatically flag rooms as norecall/noportal when you bounce off the barriers. these flags will be partially taken into account when finding paths (pathfinding will not bounce through multiple portal exits, so no "home->enter" combos). to aid in this, there is a new command "mapper portalrecall <index>" which flags a mapper portal as specifically being a recall/home type. flagged portals will show red in the portals listing.
- bug fix: health bars should now also show the enemy hp numeric overlay in modes other than "Standard"

r1319 snapshot
- new feature: (for real this time) the gmcp mapper now has the ability to stop and wait during the execution of custom exit sequences by using wait(<seconds>) as one or more movement steps. Example: wait(1.3) will pause for 1.3 seconds

r1154 snapshot
- bug fix: pressing "enter" when asked about checking for updates was not activating the update checker as players expected. now fixed.
- new feature: the chat capture window has a new option for customizing which channels get captured. this makes the creation of multiple chat capture windows as simple as copying the plugin and changing the ID.
- new feature: the "echo on/off" feature of the chat capture window has been spun off into its own plugin. commands are "chats echo on", "chats echo off", and "chats echo custom". The right-click option "Turn Echo Off" has thus been removed from the chat capture window.

- misc change: save_deleted_command is now enabled by default so you can use up arrow to recall accidentally deleted input
- bug fix: mistakes in the ascii map legend have been corrected

r1109 snapshot

r1090 snapshot
- new feature: gmcp mapper delete portal now accepts index numbers
- bug fix: gmcp mapper now reports an error if the user tries to delete a portal that doesn't exist

- bug fix: fix accidental re-saving of every mapper room
- bug fix: the gmcp mapper will now use the right color for the note indicator
- bug fix: some mapper background images were apparently missing from the repository
- bug fix: it is now possible to change the main output background color (still need to remove or rename worlds/plugins/images/aardbg13.png). plugins that get ansi text from the MUD (i.e. the ascii map and communication log window) will also use the desired background color since changing the background also requires changing text colors
- new feature: the health bars plugin now has options for percentage overlays

r1065 snapshot

- bug fix: a regression in r930 broke newlines in copied text from the communication log
